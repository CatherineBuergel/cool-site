              <p><strong>Lorem ipsum</strong> You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless
              you've known sorrow. It's all a game of angles. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. 
              Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or 
              ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into
              some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.
              I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. <br>
              <strong>Lorem ipsum</strong> I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you 
              right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. 
              This piece of canvas is your world. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.
